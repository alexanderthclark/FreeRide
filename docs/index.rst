      <p>Elegant Economics for Python</p>
   </div>

Welcome to FreeRide
===================

FreeRide is a Python package designed specifically for **introductory microeconomics education**. 
Built with elegance and simplicity in mind, it provides intuitive tools for modeling economic 
concepts that "just work" the way economics textbooks expect them to.

   <div class="feature-card">
      <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Designed for Economics 101</h3>
      <p>Every feature is crafted with introductory economics in mind. From supply and demand curves 
      to game theory, FreeRide makes economic modeling intuitive and beautiful.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="feature-card">
      <h3>âœ¨ Elegant by Design</h3>
      <p>Clean, readable code that matches textbook notation. Operations like <code>A + B</code> 
      for demand curves naturally perform horizontal summation. Beautiful plots by default.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="feature-card">
      <h3>ðŸ“Š Publication-Quality Visualizations</h3>
      <p>Every plot looks like it belongs in an economics textbook. Clean axes, automatic 
      equilibrium highlighting, and thoughtful styling make your analysis shine.</p>

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from freeride.curves import Demand, Supply
   from freeride.equilibrium import Equilibrium
   
   # Create supply and demand curves
   demand = Demand.from_formula("Q = 20 - 2*P")
   supply = Supply.from_formula("Q = -5 + 3*P")
   
   # Find equilibrium
   eq = Equilibrium(demand, supply)
   print(f"Equilibrium: P = {eq.p}, Q = {eq.q}")
   
   # Beautiful plot with one line
   eq.plot()
