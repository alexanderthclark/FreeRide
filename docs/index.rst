FreeRide is a Python package designed specifically for **introductory microeconomics**. 
Built with simplicity in mind, it provides intuitive tools for modeling economic 
concepts that "just work" the way economics students expect them to.

   <div class="feature-card">
      <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Designed for Economics 101</h3>
      <p>Every feature is crafted with introductory economics in mind. The focus is on simple cases, like linear or piecewise-linear demand curves, that illustrate key concepts.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="feature-card">
      <h3>âœ¨ Intuitive by Design</h3>
      <p>Clean, readable code that matches conventional notation. Operations like <code>a + b</code> 
      for demand curves naturally perform horizontal summation.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="feature-card">
      <h3>ðŸ“Š Learn Visually</h3>
      <p>Plotting capabilities are emphasized. Every plot looks like it belongs in an economics textbook. Clean axes, automatic equilibrium highlighting, and thoughtful styling make your analysis shine.</p>
   </div>

Installation
------------

Install FreeRide using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install freeride

**Where to run this:**

- **Mac**: Open Terminal (found in Applications â†’ Utilities)
- **Windows**: Open Command Prompt (search "cmd" in Start menu)
- **Both**: Or use Anaconda Prompt if you have Anaconda installed

**New to Python?** We recommend starting with `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_, 
which provides a free Python environment in your browser. No installation required - just run 
``!pip install freeride`` in a code cell.

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from freeride import Demand, Supply
   
   # Create supply and demand curves
   demand = Demand.from_formula("Q = 20 - 2*P")
   supply = Supply.from_formula("Q = -5 + 3*P")
   
   # Find equilibrium using the intersection operator
   market = demand & supply
   
   # Beautiful plot with shaded surplus
   market.plot(surplus=True)

   # Inspect the equilibrium
   print(market)  # shows price and quantity
   print(market.consumer_surplus)
   print(market.producer_surplus)

**Output:**

.. code-block:: text

   Market(price=5.0, quantity=10.0)
   25.0
   37.5

The plot shows the supply and demand curves with the equilibrium point clearly marked, 
and the consumer and producer surplus areas shaded:

Basic Tax Example
-----------------

We can easily add a tax to the market and visualize its effects.

.. code-block:: python

   # Apply a $2.50 tax
   market.tax = 2.5
   market.plot(surplus=True)

This plot shows the higher price paid by consumers, the lower price
received by producers, and the shaded tax revenue rectangle.
